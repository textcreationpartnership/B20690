            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE two Camps keep still their old Posts. The King has sent out several Detachments to brave the <hi>French,</hi> and does all that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Great and Experienced Captain, to provoke them to a Fight, but all in vain: Yet it is reasonably hoped that at last the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> will be forced to it, or to Retreat, by reason of several advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Posts we have rendred our selves Masters of. A Detachment of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgers</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> was lately sent out to possess themselves of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Klooster,</hi> in which there was a Garison of 300 <hi>French,</hi> but they found it deserted by them upon their Approach. They found between 60 and 70 Silver Dishes in the place, with several other Plates, several Horses, and other Cattel, with 400 pair of Shoes, and other Booty, which they immediately distributed amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> was sent Yesterday with a considerable Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (4 Men being drawn out of each Company and Troop in the whole Army, making a Body of between 13 and 14 thousand Men) to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of <hi>Thuin</hi> and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> two strong Places, especially the latter, in which there was a Garrison of 300 <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> being terrified by the Approach of this brave Prince, deserted Cowardly both places, and the Prince immediately secured them by strong Garrisons. By the taking of these two places we have entirely cut off the Communication of the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi>'s Camp with <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> and have put the <hi>French</hi> to great straits, insomuch that they must either March off, or resolve to Fight, the thing in the World we most desire.</p>
            <p>We have had several Skirmishes with the <hi>French,</hi> and have always got the better on't, kill'd many of them, and made seveeal Prisoners. Major-General <hi>Tilly,</hi> with 7 Squadrons under his Command, met 3 <hi>French</hi> Squadrons near <hi>Bois-sle-duc,</hi> killed 8 of them, and brought 25 Prisoners into our Gamp, amongst which there was a Captain of a Troop of Horse, a Lieutenant, two Cornets, and a Quarter-Master. His Majesty has ordered four Bridges to be laid over the River <hi>Eur, viz.</hi> two between <hi>Berse</hi> and <hi>Thu le Chasteau,</hi> and two others near <hi>Hauseureuse,</hi> over which a great many heavy Guns are brought to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from <hi>Namur,</hi> in order to Salute the <hi>French,</hi> who begin to be mighty uneasie; and it is certain that there is a great want of all manner of Provisions amongst them; <hi>Dinant</hi> and <hi>Philipville</hi> being in no condition to furnish much longer so great an Army. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we have a very gallant Army, full of Courage and Bravery, and the greatest Plenty imaginable of all sorts of Provisions; and all this by the Indefatigable Care His Majesty chearfully takes for the very lowest man in his Army: And on the other hand, he is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beloved from the highest to the lowest, that I dare conndently assure you, that there is no man in the whole Army who would not be exceeding glad to sacrifice his Life for so Great, Good, and Generous a Prince. A Famous <hi>French</hi> Engeneer, who has deserted from <hi>Dinant,</hi> is taken into the King's Service. He has delivered His Majesty an exact Draught of the Fortifications of that place, and we generally believe it will be Besieged at last; nay, there is a confident Report as if it was invested since yesterday. Out of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> we have daily fresh Accounts of the brave and undaunted behaviour of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois.</hi> They were lately Attacked by the <hi>French</hi> from three sides, whereupon they secured the Rear to Retreat in case of Necessity, and fell so heavily upon the <hi>French,</hi> who to the number of 1100, were commanded by <hi>Larreé</hi> and <hi>de Vins,</hi> that they killed 300 upon the spot, and put the rest to flight, who would not have escap'd them neither, if they had not been secur'd by a great Mist that is very common in those Valleys. The <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> did not lose one Man. They have also strenuously repulsed a Party sent out of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> by Mons. <hi>De Herbeville,</hi> in order to Attack the Valley of <hi>St. Lucern.</hi> Another <hi>French</hi> Party, who Attacked for three several times <hi>La Monta,</hi> were beaten off, and forced to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, leaving 300 upon the Spot behind them, amongst whom there is a Lieutenant of the Granadiers: And to Grown all, 6000 of them have lately made great Incursions into <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> whereupon all the Country People are retired into the strong Placer, insomuch that for several Leagues together, there is not one Man to be found in the Villages.</p>
